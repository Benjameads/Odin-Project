    <!-- This is a link. used by <a> & </a>. 
        However, without an href the link is pointless. the href tells the website where to re-direct you.
        If the link is another website, it's called an "absolute link" meaning that the file/location is just not local to your device. This means it must have an https://www.website.com 
        If you have the file downloaded locally. You can simpily reference the file its in. this is called "relative link"
    
        The "target" tag, tells the link where to open the link tab wise. If left blank/not used, the link will open in the current tab. However, if you want it to open in a seperate tab. You make target equal to "_blank"
        The "rel" tag is for security. If you leave blank, it allows the linked website to access yours. If you make rel equal to "noopener noreferrer" The linked website cannot access or see your website. This is for security purposes.
        Finally, you must add the name the link shows up as.-->
