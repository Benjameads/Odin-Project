    <h2>Description:</h2>
    <p>This is an easy meal ready for you when you want to make something quick, delicious, and satisfying, without too much cooking, or dishes afterwards. 
        I cannot claim that this is a healthy meal, but the taste of it makes you think that maybe... One cheat meal isn't too bad.
    </p>
    <h2>Ingredient List:</h2>
    <u1>
        <li>Pasta of your choice</li>
        <li>Chicken Breast</li>
        <li>Alfredo Sauce</li>
        <li>Your choice of seasonings.</li>
        <li>Oil or Butter</li>
    </u1>
    <h2>Instructions:</h2>
    <ol>
        <li>Place a large pot (big enough to fit your noodles) onto the stove and sprinkle in some salt. Bring the water to a boil.</li>
        <li>While the water is coming to boil. Take out the chicken breast and cut up into bite sized pieces. </li>
        <li>Place a saucepan onto the stove and set to medium high heat. Add drizzle of cooking oil or butter</li>
        <li>When the pan is hot. Add in chicken and cook until the chicken is white in the middle. (You can turn up the heat and char the chicken, this adds flavor at the risk of burning)</li>
        <li>When water is boiling, pour pasta into bowl and allow to boil until pasta is soft.</li>
        <li>Pour pasta into strainer and Place into a large serving bowl. (Or back into the pot if you want to keep dishes to a minimum, just make sure the pot has cooled and wont burn pasta)</li>
        <li>Add alfredo sauce and chicken to the pasta, stir, and add any seasonings (I like to include garlic salt, and chilli pepper flakes)</li>
        <li>Enjoy!</li>
    </ol>
    <p>I hope you enjoy this quick and easy dinner! I also hope you enjoy the lack of dishes afterwards! This meal also reheats in the microwave very easily.</p>
